changes wallpaper on a timer if you don't have access to the Windows settings

Need to evaluate and test if permissions are affected. This is a port to nodejs and should eventually be made into an exe with pkg.

I am doing this because Windows 10 does not allow slideshow with the same wallpaper on all displays. Microsoft oversight or over simplification of software.

* Targets Windows 7
* You are provided a system tray icon in which you can change the timer from every 1 minute to 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.
* You can choose to pic a random image at any point in time.
